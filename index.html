        A waterfall is a natural feature where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops in the course of a river or stream.
         Waterfalls typically form in the upper course of a river where the flow of water is strong and the landscape is more rugged.
          They occur when a river meets a sudden change in elevation, often due to erosion-resistant rock overlaying softer rock beneath.
           Over time, the softer rock erodes faster, causing a drop, which the water then flows overâ€”forming a waterfall.
